2. Analytical Process
Data Aggregation and Categorization

Metrics such as total wins, points, time on court, and assisted/unassisted scores were calculated and grouped by teams, players, and seasons.
Visual Representation

Bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and line graphs were employed to visualize the data for ease of comparison and trend analysis.
Correlational and Comparative Analysis

Correlations between variables (e.g., field goal assists and team reliance on team play) were explored.
Trends over time and differences in game type performance were examined.
3. Managerial Insights
Team Outcomes

Insight: SAS and DAL are among the top-performing teams with the highest win counts, while NOH lags significantly.
Actionable Decision: For underperforming teams like NOH, evaluate coaching strategies, player dynamics, and training programs to improve results.
Player Scoring Distribution

Insight: Players like Zylan Cheatham and Tyrese Maxey contribute heavily, with a balanced mix of 2PT, 3PT, and FT scores. Players with minimal contributions should be reviewed for potential roster changes.
Actionable Decision: Focus training on increasing the scoring versatility of lower-performing players.
Time on Court

Insight: Some players spend significantly more time on the court, which might indicate dependency or fatigue risks.
Actionable Decision: Balance player time on court to avoid overuse and optimize team performance through effective rotations.
Assisted vs. Unassisted Scoring

Insight: Teams with higher assisted scoring percentages (e.g., above 80%) emphasize team play. This indicates strong coordination but potential vulnerability to defensive disruption.
Actionable Decision: For teams overly reliant on assisted scoring, develop strategies for individual scoring to diversify attack options.
Game Type Performance

Insight: A larger portion of games is regular season-based, with fewer playoff games. Teams excelling in playoffs are better at clutch performance.
Actionable Decision: Analyze playoff-specific strategies and identify areas for improvement in high-stakes games.
Season-wise Trends

Insight: Team performance peaks in certain seasons. External factors such as roster changes, injuries, or competition strength could explain fluctuations.
Actionable Decision: Study top-performing seasons to replicate successful strategies in future campaigns.
Point Source Analysis

Insight: Teams like DEN and PHX rely heavily on fast-break points, while others adopt a more structured offensive strategy.
Actionable Decision: For teams over-relying on fast breaks, ensure robust half-court offense development to handle situations where fast-break opportunities are limited.
Conclusion
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of basketball performance, offering insights into team strategies, player utilization, and scoring efficiency. Leveraging these insights, managers can refine team strategies, optimize player rotations, and focus on areas needing improvement to enhance overall performance and competitiveness.
